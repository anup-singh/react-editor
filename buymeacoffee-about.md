# Hey there! I'm Anup 👋

## The Story Behind React Content Editor ☕

Picture this: I was working late one night (again), struggling with yet another clunky text editor that just wouldn't cooperate with my React app. Sound familiar? That frustration sparked something bigger – the React Content Editor.

### 🚀 From Midnight Code Sessions to 10,000+ Happy Developers

What started as a personal solution to my own editor headaches has grown into something amazing. The React Content Editor now powers content creation for thousands of developers worldwide, from indie hackers building their first SaaS to enterprise teams at Fortune 500 companies.

**But here's the thing** – maintaining and improving open source projects takes time. A lot of time. Time I could spend on paid consulting, but instead, I choose to invest in building tools that make every developer's life a little bit easier.
